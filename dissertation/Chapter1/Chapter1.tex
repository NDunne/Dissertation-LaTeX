\section{Introduction}
%The introduction should provide content for the report, discuss relevant background material and state the main aims of the work. Clearly establishing the aims of the work is important for this coursework, since you have a great deal of freedom in what you will seek to achieve.

In the field of High Performance Computing (HPC), computers with processing power hundreds of times greater than conventionally available machines are used to solve or approximate complex problems. Such systems almost always utilize parallelism, which involves multiple processing units working simultaneously on a single problem, to find solutions within a tractable time.
\par Many paradigms for executing parallel workloads have emerged over time. Recently, General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) have become an increasingly popular hardware architecture, having originally been conceived as specialised hardware for graphical shader calculations. GPU's high number of parallel processing units allow a high degree of parallelism, as well as being able to execute operations usually done by the CPU. Passing compute-heavy workloads to a GPU device can lead to significant speed-ups over sequential execution, and remove the CPU as a bottleneck.
\par
Commonly, a single developer or team is unlikely to have both the necessary expertise in a niche area of physics with a non-trivial problem to be solved; and also sufficient depth of knowledge in computer science to understand the latest generation of parallel hardware. For this reason the OP2 framework was created: to provide a high level abstraction in which HPC applications can be written, and separate the application code from the optimisation requirements. OP2 is already able to generate optimised code for a number of back-ends from an application file.
\par
This report details an investigation into implementing and benchmarking a new optimisation to the GPU code generation in OP2. The optimisation is named ``Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation" for its similarities to a comparable process often performed by compilers when run-time efficiency is desired. All compilation that takes place prior to run-time is referred to as ``Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation".

\subsection{Motivations}
The idea for this project was provided by my supervisor, Dr Gihan Mudalige - an Associate Professor in the University of Warwick Computer Science Department. It was pulled from the pool of uncompleted features for the OP2 project, and was selected because it aligned with my interest in High Performance Computing, and previous experience with optimising existing codes.
\par
Since OP2 is Open Source and freely available, the implementation I produce will become part of the framework, allowing future contributors to build on my work.

\subsection{Background Work}
\label{s:bgwork}

In order to become comfortable with the OP2 framework and provide a useful contribution, it is important to understand the domain of problems for which it was created: Unstructured Mesh Solvers.
\par
A large proportion of HPC workloads involve approximating Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to simulate complex interactions in physics problems, for example the Navier-Stokes equations for computational fluid dynamics, or predicting weather patterns. It is usually necessary to discretise such problems, which means dividing a continuous space into a number of discrete cells such as in Figure \ref{fig:2dmesh}.\par

\noindent Depending on its structure, a mesh can be described as either structured (regular) or unstructured. Structured meshes such as in Figure \ref{fig:struct} are made up of cells following a regular pattern, while unstructured meshes use connectivity information to specify the mesh topology, as in Figure \ref{fig:umesh}.

        \draw (\x, 0) -- (0, \x) ;

\noindent A particular simulation might, for example, be approximating the velocity of a fluid in each cell, and at every time step re-calculate this value based on the values of cells around it. A program utilising a structured mesh will make use of a repeating pattern to calculate values, which is commonly referred to as a `stencil code' \cite{stencil}. An example of a 2D stencil is shown in Figure \ref{fig:stencil}.\par

  \foreach \y in {0,...,2}{
    \node [fill=none, draw=black, thick, minimum size=1cm]
      at (\x+.5, \y+.5) {};
  }
}

\node [fill=black] at (1.5, 1.5) {};

\draw[->,>=latex, red, line width=3mm] (0.1,1.5) -- (1.3,1.5);
\draw[->,>=latex, red, line width=3mm] (2.9,1.5) -- (1.7,1.5);
\draw[->,>=latex, red, line width=3mm] (1.5,0.1) -- (1.5,1.3);
\draw[->,>=latex, red, line width=3mm] (1.5,2.9) -- (1.5,1.7);

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Example 2D stencil code}
\label{fig:stencil}
\end{figure}
\noindent Unstructured meshes cannot use a stencil as the underlying mesh is irregular, so instead they must use indirect array accesses where a value retrieved from one array is used to index another array. When a value is updated, multiple levels of memory reference indirection will be involved, as a list of neighbouring points must be obtained, and their values loaded \cite[p10]{berkley}. This is much more computationally intensive that accessing data using a stencil.
