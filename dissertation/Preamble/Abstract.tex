The OP2 Domain Specific Language was created to simplify the process of writing unstructured mesh solver applications for High Performance Computing uses. This report details the implementation of a new optimisation to the code generation, which re-compiles at runtime when the inputs to the program are known, as well as the benchmarking of this optimisation on a representative example application.
