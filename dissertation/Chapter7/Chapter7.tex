\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}

This project was developed as an investigation into a new optimisation for the GPU code generation of the OP2 framework. As part of this investigation, an implementation of the technique was produced, and the results benchmarked to determine if the optimisation is able to provide benefit.
\par
The implementation was completed, producing the functionality for execution of JIT compiled code, and applied an optimisation made based on the inputs of the program, which can only be done at runtime - defining the constant values for the pre-processor.
\par
The results from this benchmarking were unfortunate, in that there was no benefit from the runtime, however it is important to draw the distinction that the defining of constants was not able to provide speedup, and not that JIT compilation as a technique does not have potential to speedup.
\par
It is likely that adding loop blocking as a runtime optimisation would produce better results, and adding this feature will have been made easier by the work completed for this project. It is unfortunate that there was not enough time to implement loop blocking, and benchmark it suffiently.
\par
Overall,
